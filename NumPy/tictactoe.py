"""
Write a script to play two-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe between a human 
player and the computer. Use a 3-by-3 two-dimensional array. Each 
player indicates their moves by entering a pair of numbers representing 
the row and column indices of the square in which they want to place 
their mark, either an 'X' or an 'O'. When the first player moves, 
place an 'X' in the specified square. With the computer choice, place 
an 'O' in the specified square. Each move must be to an empty square. 
After each move, determine whether the game has been won and whether 
itâ€™s a draw. Also, allow the player to specify whether he or she wants 
to go first or second.
